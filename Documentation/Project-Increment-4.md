## Project Goal and Objectives:
The main aim of the project is to develop a version control system for deep learning models( source code, input and output data files, metrics about the experiment)similar to GIT.

## Project Increment -1
1) Getting familiar with GIT open source code.
2) Understanding the requirements and coming up with the design for the functionality of dlv commands. 
3) Implementing dlv init, add and commit commands.

## Project Increment - 2:
1) Creating Basic User Interface for version control system similar to GIT desktop.
2) Modifying Increment 1 commands to clear all the bugs.
3) Implemented commands {status, history, push, diff of files}
4) Implementing commands {list, desc, diff between models}

## Project Increment - 3:
1) Creating Basic User Interface for Deep learning Version control system.   
2) User can Register and Authenticate into DLV.    
3) After Login User can upload files/repositories to the server.   

## Project Increment - 4:
1) Improving the User Interface and to clear all console errors
2) After login User can view List of repositories.    
3) On click of the repository -> It shows the status and history of the files in the repository.    
4) Frequent polling of status GET request for every 30sec to get list of modified files.
5) Updating all details about the repository( list,status, history) after user clicks the commit.
